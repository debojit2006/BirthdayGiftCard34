            <h2>A Letter for You </h2>
            <p>
               To Bahnishikha,
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, in the quiet corners of life, we meet people who feel like a soft melody‚Äîfamiliar yet unforgettable. You're one of those rare souls. You carry a kind of light that's never loud, but it gently lingers in every room you walk into, and even more so, in the hearts of those lucky enough to know you.

You have a beauty that‚Äôs far beyond the surface‚Äîit's in your words, in the way you listen, and in the strength behind your quietness. The world may often overlook how rare that kind of grace is, but I hope you never do. You should be proud‚Äînot just of how you look, but of the person you‚Äôve become.

There‚Äôs something about you‚Ä¶ something that stays even after the conversation ends. Maybe it‚Äôs the way you make people feel seen without trying too hard.  Or maybe‚Äîit‚Äôs just you being you.

I won‚Äôt say too much, because some things are better left between the lines. 
And if you ever wonder whether you're appreciated, admired, or quietly cherished‚Äîmaybe read this again.


            <p>
                
            <p>
                
            <p>
                Always rooting for you,
‚ÄîDebojit
